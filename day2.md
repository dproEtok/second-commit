                INTRODUCTION TO LINUX
what is linux ?
               Linux is Kernel
what is Kernel ?
      . Kernel is a code/program that used to meet your software and hardware.
          and alocate some resources.
     
            HISTORY OF LINUX 

.in 1969 a team led by computer scientists KEN THOMPSON and DENNIS RITCHIE created the first 
version of UNIX on a PDP-7 minicomputer.

.but it wasn't cheap and open source
.then person called "LINUS TORVALDS" created the linux kernel.and posted it online to make it 
OPEN-SOURCE.
.RICHARED STALLMAN announced the gnu linux project in 1983 and cofounded the free software
foundation in 1985.
.GNU is a free software replacement to the UNIX Os but it was just software replacement not full os 
{examples: bash ,tar ,emacs...}
so GNU + LINUX will give the GNU/LINUX Os.
      
       WHAT IS SHELL ?
       .users communicate with the kernel by the SHELL
       .the shell is a command line interpreter.
     TYPES OF SHELLS
         .SH
         .BASH
         .ZSH
         .FISH
> they differ in colouring,piping,command complition,some kind of features.
- to identify your shell "evho$shell"
   
WHAT IS OS (OPERATING SYSTEM) ?
    we have said unix and gnu/linux as os but what is OS.
a program to manage everything and run all the programs.
            .IT CONTAINS:
                >  kernel
                >  softwares
                >  desktop environment
                >  file extensions
                >  window manager
TYPES OF DESKTOP ENVIRONMENT ON LINUX
         A. Mate
         B. Gnome
         C. KDE plasma
         D. XFCE
WHICH DESKTOP ENVIRONMENT IS BEST ?
     speed depends on :
         .Animations
         .High Graphics
         .Quality
       >? Do you have slow pc.....
 if your pc slow or have minimum Ram
 use below desktop environment
        .window manager
why linux fast ?
    . no high space computer/device needed
   linux distributions/distro
.distro is modified linux kernels,type of operating systems with different :
        - linux kernel
        - packages (gnu)
        - package manager
        - desktop ui
so many distros....
        . Debian
             kali linux
             ubuntu
             parrot
        . Arch
             black
             arch
            garuda
     . Fedora
     . Red hat
     . Gentoo
     . Android
which is best for hackers?
      .kali linux
      .parrot os
      .garuda
      .black arch
Kali linux 
     kali linux is debian-derived linux distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing
it is maintained and funded by offensive security.
Parrot os 
   parrot os is a linux distribution based on debian with a focus on security,privacy, and development
Garuda
    garuda linux is a linux distribution based on the Arch linux operating system.
do windows have distros?
     .windows is not open-source so peoples won't use/edit it, so there won't be other kind.
how can we use it?
  A) main os /main-boot
  B)dualboot/2 in 1
  C)live boot
  D)cloud terminals
  E)virtual machine
  F)wsl   (windows subsystem for linux)
